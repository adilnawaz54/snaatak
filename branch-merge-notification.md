##  Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to set up automated notifications via email and Slack when a branch is merged into the main branch of a GitHub repository. It also defines how to restrict branch merges to specific authorized users, ensuring only designated contributors can merge branches into the main branch. Additionally, it outlines the process of configuring branch protection rules to enforce these restrictions.


##  Pre-requisites

### 9. Verify Slack Notification

**Once you add the workflow file, every time a commit is pushed to the specified repo (e.g., branch-merge-notification-demo), the GitHub Action will send an slack notification on your channel.**

##  Steps to Set up Branch Merging Notification for Email

> 👉 **Follow Documentation**: [Email Setup](

##  Conclusion

In this document, we implemented email and Slack notifications for branch merges into the main branch, with specific permissions for merging restricted to authorized users. We encountered a limitation in enforcing branch protection rules on private repositories under the free GitHub plan, which requires an upgrade to a GitHub Team or Enterprise account. As a workaround, manual review processes and Git hooks were suggested to control merges. The final setup ensures notifications and proper authorization for merging branches into the main branch.
