### Disaster Recovery

In the event of a disaster affecting the application's functionality, it's important to have a robust disaster recovery plan in place. It typically ensures that critical systems and data can be restored after a disaster.

Disaster could be caused by a natural disaster, a cyberattack, or other event that takes down your IT infrastructure.

### High Availability

Ensuring high availability of the application is crucial to minimize downtime and provide seamless service to users. High Availability is a design approach that minimizes downtime for critical systems and services. This is achieved by deploying redundant components and systems, so that if one component fails, another can take over.

Note: In other words, DR is focused on recovering from a disaster, while HA is focused on preventing downtime.
